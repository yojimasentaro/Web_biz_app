Followings are two busineess models that can be applied into our project. -Kasumi

Paid app business model

The paid app business model means the app is not free to download. Users must first purchase it from the app store before using it. As our app has unique functions, paid app business model can be used. We can earn revenue upfront with every new download. And people who have paid for it are more likely to turn into engaged users since they have spent money to purchase it. 

In-app purchases

We can sale some additional services in our app. Here are some ideas. 
* One is developing a recommend cameraman list that would be showed on the home page of our app and those cameramen who what to be added into this list should pay some money. 
* Another is developing a cameraman ranking system. People who want to use this ranking system to help them decide which cameraman to select should pay some money. 
* Moreover, we can hold some on-line events, like inviting famous cameramen to give lectures and inviting famous models to share experiences. These events can charge.
